Personal website's (blog) redirection

Entering shrafatkarim.github.io will redirect you to [sharafat.pages.dev](https://sharafat.pages.dev/)

## Why redirection?
I moved my webpage there (cloudflare page) cause I may use some sensitive information in the config file of the website. But you can still read or contribute to my webpage. If you want to create a website like that one, I've a free template available for you!

It's posts are available in a open public repository,
